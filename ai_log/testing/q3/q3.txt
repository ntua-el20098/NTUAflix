list all request(app). functions
ChatGPT
The request function in the context of testing with Supertest is typically used for making HTTP requests to your Express application. Below are some common HTTP methods that can be used with the request(app) function:

GET Method:

javascript
Copy code
request(app).get('/endpoint')
POST Method:

javascript
Copy code
request(app).post('/endpoint')
PUT Method:

javascript
Copy code
request(app).put('/endpoint')
PATCH Method:

javascript
Copy code
request(app).patch('/endpoint')
DELETE Method:

javascript
Copy code
request(app).delete('/endpoint')
These methods can be chained with other methods provided by Supertest for making assertions and handling responses. Some common methods include:

.send(data): Send data in the request body.

javascript
Copy code
request(app).post('/endpoint').send({ key: 'value' })
.query(params): Attach query parameters to the URL.

javascript
Copy code
request(app).get('/endpoint').query({ param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2' })
.set(headers): Set request headers.

javascript
Copy code
request(app).get('/endpoint').set('Authorization', 'Bearer token')
.expect(statusCode): Expect a specific HTTP status code in the response.

javascript
Copy code
request(app).get('/endpoint').expect(200)
.end(callback): End the request and execute the callback with the response.

javascript
Copy code
request(app).get('/endpoint').end((err, res) => { /* handle response */ })
These are some of the common methods you can use with the request(app) function in Supertest. The exact methods available might depend on the version of Supertest you are using, and you can refer to the official documentation for more details: Supertest Documentation.
