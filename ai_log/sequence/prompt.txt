USER:
can you help me create a sequence uml diagram?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATGPT:

Absolutely, I can help you create a sequence diagram! To get started, please provide 
some details about the system or scenario you want to represent in the sequence diagram. 
Include the relevant actors (objects), their interactions, and any specific messages or 
actions you'd like to illustrate. The more information you provide, the more accurate 
and tailored the sequence diagram can be.

USER:
The subject of the work is the development of "ntuaflix", a software application for
navigation of movie and series data, the extraction of statistics with various criteria,
as well as the creation and management of personal collections, recommendations for monitoring, etc.
The work includes requirements identification and specification, architecture and
detailed design, implementation of selected functions, control and documentation of all
of these.
The er diagram is:
Entities:
People:
attributes: nconst	primaryName	birthYear	deathYear	img_url_asset
primaryProfession_id:
attributes: nconst primaryProfession
knownForTitles_id:
attributes: nconst knownForTitles	
Title:
attributes: tconst	titleType	primaryTitle	originalTitle	isAdult	startYear	endYear	runtimeMinutes img_url_asset
Genre_id:
attributes: tconst genre
Akas:
attributes: titleId	ordering	title	region	language	types	attributes	isOriginalTitle
Episodes:
attributes: tconst	parentTconst	seasonNumber	episodeNumber
Principals:
attributes: tconst	ordering	nconst	category	job	characters	img_url_asset
Ratings:
attributes: tconst	averageRating	numVotes

can you help me make a sequence uml diagram ??

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATGPT:
Certainly! To create a sequence diagram for your "ntuaflix" application, we need to 
identify the main actors and the interactions between them. Based on the provided 
information, I'll make some assumptions about the interactions. Please feel free to 
modify or add details as needed.

Let's consider a scenario where a user searches for a movie, views details, and adds 
it to their personal collection. We'll include interactions with the People, Title, 
Genre, Akas, Episodes, Principals, and Ratings entities. Keep in mind that this is 
just a sample scenario, and you can customize it according to your specific 
requirements.

Here's a simplified sequence diagram:

This is a basic representation, and you may need to add more details or modify it based on the specific functionalities and interactions 
in your application. Let me know if you need further clarification or if you have specific interactions in mind that you'd like to include in the sequence diagram.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER:
the user enters Ntuaflix and is given 2 options:
- either to stay on the "Movie-Series" page, to navigate to it, to click on a movie-series, 
he can also do the same by using filters (for the genre or for the Grading)
- either click on "People" and see the people who make up the films-series on this page 
you can either click on a person or search by name

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATGPT:Great! Let's update the sequence diagram to include the user's interaction with the "Ntuaflix" application when choosing between the "Movie-Series" 
page and the "People" page. We'll also include interactions related to navigation, filtering, and viewing details. Here's an updated version:

I've adjusted the numbering to ensure the sequence of actions is more accurate. If you have any further questions or if there's anything 
else you'd like to modify, please let me know!

USER:
the name  Title is correct?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATGPT:
Yes, the name "Title" is used in the sequence diagram to represent the entity related to movies and series. In your provided ER diagram, 
it looks like "Title" is the entity that contains information about movies and series, such as title type, primary title, original title, 
and other attributes.

If you have a specific term you'd prefer to use instead of "Title" or if there's a different name for this entity in your system, feel 
free to let me know, and I can adjust the sequence diagram accordingly.

USER:
but that's where "Choose People" ends

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHATGPT:
I appreciate your clarification. It seems there was a mistake in the sequence diagram. Let me correct that for you. Please find the 
revised sequence diagram below:

In this corrected version, the sequence diagram continues after the "Choose People" action. The interactions related to searching for people, 
retrieving people, and displaying people details are included. If you have further adjustments or specific details you'd like to include, 
feel free to let me know!

In this revised version, the sequence starts with the user already on the "Movie-Series" page upon opening "Ntuaflix." The interactions 
include applying filters, retrieving movies, displaying movie details, and adding a movie to the collection. If you have any further 
adjustments or specific details you'd like to include, feel free to let me know!
